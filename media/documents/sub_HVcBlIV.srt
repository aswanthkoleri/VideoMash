1
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,300
Hey!

2
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,140
I know we haven't seen each other

3
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,760
And we haven't talked to each other in  while

4
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,960
But I want to you know

5
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,860
That I've been doing a lot of thinking lately..

6
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,540
...and...

7
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,360
I want to you know that

8
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,540
I miss you.

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,560
Not

10
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,860
I regret what happened

11
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:24,840
or

12
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,680
I want to see you again

13
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,180
 

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,160
Just...

15
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,780
I miss you.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,560
Just...

17
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,820
I miss you.

18
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,080
It's so strange to think that someone I knew so well

19
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,660
Is now a total stranger to me

20
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:55,500
That sometimes I go entire days without thinking about you

21
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,960
Most of the time, I let myself forget

22
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,460
because it's easier

23
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,000
But then I find something

24
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,380
a photo

25
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,240
a gift

26
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,520
the stupid love letters we used to give eachother

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,200
and the full weight of  what's been lost  crashes down on me

28
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,600
part of me wants to see you again

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,120
to hold you again

30
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,160
to kiss you again

31
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,820
but all those feelings become empty thoughts

32
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,420
when I look back now

33
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,740
remember being love isn't always what it seems

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,440
it's just so easy to forget

35
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,900
but this isn't regret

36
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
we have a reasons for ending it

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
and they are as valid as ever

38
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
but back at the start

39
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,580
we didn't need any reasons to fall in love

40
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,600
we just did

41
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,820
the reasons came at the end

42
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,700
and everything since than has been about reasons

43
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,920
and that's good

44
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,200
means that one day I'll find someone who I won't have to say goodbye to

45
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,680
but...

46
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,300
a part of me just misses loving someone

47
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,360
and having them love you back

48
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,560
that's all

49
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
I guess what I'm saying is

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,880
I hope things are good with you

51
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,240
I hope everything it's great

52
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,060
I hope everything it's great

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,060
I hope you found a love

54
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,160
that's all the things ours couldn't be

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,300
but...

56
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,140
just a small part of me hopes that you still remember what it was like

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,080
before all the reasons

58
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,720
and that

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,440
you miss me

60
00:04:49,060 --> 00:00:00,000
too.
